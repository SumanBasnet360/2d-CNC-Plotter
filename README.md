This is a 2D CNC printer that uses a pen to draw the contents of the gcode file on a 4cm x 4cm paper.
I have used DVD stepper motors for X and Y axis and a servo for the Z axis.

I use Pronterface to control the printer.

You can convert PNG to vector and generate gcode from vector files in Inkscape by using an exension that I have linked below
